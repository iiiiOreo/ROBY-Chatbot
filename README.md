# ROBY Chatbot:

A Python chatbot designed with the aim of providing dynamic and intelligent conversations. Utilizing natural language processing, the chatbot interprets user input to generate appropriate responses from a predefined set of intents. The underlying machine learning model is trained on an extensive dataset, allowing ROBY to understand and respond to a variety of user queries.

The chatbot's capabilities extend beyond typical conversational exchanges. ROBY can also handle mathematical expressions, enabling users to input expressions for evaluation. The application utilizes a neural network model built with the Keras library to recognize patterns and generate responses. The model is trained on a diverse set of intents stored in a JSON file, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to user inputs.

The graphical user interface is built using Tkinter, providing an interactive and user-friendly environment. The chat history is displayed in a text widget, allowing users to track conversations. The application supports various functionalities, including retrieving the current time and date, making it a versatile companion for users seeking information and assistance.
